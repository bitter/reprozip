# A super-simple version of PASS, implemented using SystemTap
# by Philip Guo, 2011-10-31

# Tested on Fedora 14 with this kernel version: 2.6.35.14-103.fc14.x86_64

# Use this command to create a series of 10MB output files:
#   stap -o /var/log/burrito/stap.out -S 10 pass-lite.stp

# Use a double pipe '||' delimiter for fields since that pattern doesn't
# seem to appear in filenames

# For reference, refer to syscall stubs in:
#   /usr/share/systemtap/tapset/syscalls.stp
#   /usr/share/systemtap/tapset/syscalls2.stp
